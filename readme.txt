Give your WordPress website the power of Stormpath Authentication.

== Description ==

With this plugin, you are replacing your local users with users inside of the Stormpath ecosystem. We have
designed this plugin to look and act the same as the built in user authentication, but give you the power
of Stormpath authentication.


== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/stormpath` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Stormpath screen to configure the plugin
4. Add your api key file (this is the recommended version)
    a. This should not be uploaded with the WordPress media library.  Please store the file in a secure location.
    b. If you can not upload a file outside of WordPress, you can use the api key id and secret directly, however these will be stored in plain text.
